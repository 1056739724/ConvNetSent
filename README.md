# Convolutional Neural Network for Sentence Classification, in TensorFlow
This is a full (slightly modified and extended) TensorFlow implementation of the model presented by Kim in [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1181).

## Features:
- Supporting Random, Static, and non-Static modesrerer
- Runs on (almost) all datasets from the original article + 2 srom [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03820) + 2 new ones.
